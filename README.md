Wow, okay just walked out of the theater and it’s like my brain’s been squeezed through a pasta press… Control Freak was a trip. They should give you a medal for surviving, like, ah sensory overload everywhere. Popcorn all over my lap, and my back, ugh, why didn't I do some stretches before sitting down? Can still feel the chair in my spine.

> Man, it was just—phew—colors, lights, like if a disco ball had a nightmare after spicy tacos. That scene, you know the one with the pigeons doing choreography? Like Picasso decided to paint with CGI birds. 

There's this part where the protagonist practically argues with a coffee machine, and, for real, it felt like I was back chatting with a stubborn massage chair. Ever try negotiating with technology? It's worse than untangling earphones. But yeah, someone said I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Probably, I dunno, replay it like a fever dream when you can’t sleep.

The whole theater was buzzing, literally, someone's phone kept vibrating and I thought it was some new-fangled surround sound. I should've brought my own chair or something—with the built-in massager. My back's gonna need a vacation after this one. 

And yeah, so the villain has this wild control room, like a kid with way too many action figures, but they all have laser eyes. Ridiculous? Sure. But I was into it. It’s like, you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , and it 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩es you back, daring you to not be confused. 

Gotta mention, can’t forget, the soundtrack was like if Radiohead and a lawnmower had a baby—it’s a compliment, really. Should’t be, but is. And hey sandy popcorn is new, apparently. 

Somewhere in the chaos, I remembered someone asked me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again. Not sure if that's a dare or a plea for explanation.
